<h1>My Best Movies According to SEyifunmi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The 100</h3>
<p>This is my faviourite at any time. Is about 100 teenages sent to earth to check if the earth is safe for human kind. But what they met is beyond imigination. if you have not watch it am recomending it.</p>
<h3>Seven Doors</h3>
<p>
Seven doors is also one of my best movies. Is all about an ordinary man with a lovely family becoming king. Becoming king came with a lot of challenges for him facing an unknown curse and his family. You can go fot this too.</p>
<h3>The Flash</h3>
<p>Very interesting and funny. Is all about a guy getting power to run fast. He became the fastest man on earth. He started helping people with his power and taking down those using there power to cause any harm. Is actually a nice movie to watch. If you love super heros movies go for teh falsh and you will love it.er
